# 3D printed utilities

These are some utilities that have needed in 360 shots or VR work. Feel free to check my [thingiverse profile](https://www.thingiverse.com/sergiobd/designs) and my [webpage](www.alterlab.io).

These are the utilities:

* GoPro battery case (for Hero4 batteries)
* HTC Vive lighthouse adapter (for using the wall-mount in a light-stand or tripod)
* Ricoh Theta holder (for using with GoPro accesories)
