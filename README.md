# VR-Misc
A set of miscelaneous tools for virtual reality and 360 videos. So far this repo contains:

## Rigs
(STL files for 3D printing)

* A rig for two GoPros in back-to-back configuration, all ports accessible.
* A rig for four GoPros in square configuration, all ports accesible (a nice and small rig that can even fit in your pocket).

## 3D printed utilities
(STL files for 3D printing)
* A GoPro battery case for four batteries (HERO 4)
* A Lighthouse adapter (so you can use the wall mount in a light-stand)
* A Ricoh Theta S holder (to attach a Theta to GoPro accesories)

## Scripts
* A script for organizing your material into *takes* (vs. by cameras, which is very inconvenient)
